Julien, thank you for writing.
BSD license is fine, modification is OK.
There are more build scripts available in the web site distributions than 
there are on the Netlib.  I think there is an update to Planck's radiation
function that I haven't sent to Netlib yet.  But Netlib is a more stable
site, so it is better to cite that as a reference.
